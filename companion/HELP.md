- Presets - Tap to recall or hold for 2 seconds to save. When a camera preset button is held for 2 seconds, all camera preset buttons will highlight yellow indicating the preset is saved and you can let go.

**Note:** The implementation has changed since Companion 2.4.x. If you used "Cam Presets" in previous versions the recall function for those buttons works as expected but save function will no longer work. This can be fixed by replacing it with a new preset or by deleting the `savePsetLongPress` action from an existing button and adding a duration group with the action "Save Preset".
